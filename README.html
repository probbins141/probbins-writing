<h1 id="balzac">Balzac</h1>

<p>This is forked from <a href="http://mademistakes.com">minimal mistakes</a>. I needed some type of framework to build off as I have no experience with Jekyll. Michael set up an awesome dev environment for this which really helped speed up my progress. He also already wrote up an incredibly comprehensive readme.md so I basically copied all of it and replaced what was necessary. The design itself is my own and I cannot let you sell this or tweak the design for resale, unless I you <a href="mailto:cole@coletownsend.com">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>If you’d like give me credit somewhere on your blog or tweet a shout out to
<a href="https://twitter.com/twnsndco">@twnsndco</a>, that would be pretty sweet.</p>

<h1 id="customization">Customization</h1>

<h2 id="_configyml">_config.yml</h2>

<p>Most of the variables found here are used in the .html files found in <code>_includes</code> if you need to add or remove anything. A good place to start would be to change the title, tagline, description, and url of your site. When working locally comment out <code>url</code> or else you will get a bunch of broken links because they are absolute and prefixed with `` in the various <code>_includes</code> and <code>_layouts</code>. Just remember to uncomment <code>url</code> when building for deployment or pushing to <strong>gh-pages</strong>…</p>

<h3 id="ownerauthor-information">Owner/Author Information</h3>

<p>Change your name, bio, Twitter url, email, Dribbble URL, etc.</p>

<h3 id="top-navigation-links">Top Navigation Links</h3>

<p>Edit page/post titles and URLs to include in the site’s navigation. For external links add <code>external: true</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml"># sample top navigation links
links:
  - title: About Page
    url: /about
  - title: Other Page
    url: /other-page
  - title: External Page
    url: http://coletownsend.com
    external: true
</code></pre>

<h2 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h2>

<p>The rest is just your average Jekyll config settings. Nothing too crazy here…</p>

<h3 id="_includes">_includes</h3>

<p>For the most part you can leave these as is since the author/owner details are pulled from <code>_config.yml</code>. That said you’ll probably want to customize the copyright stuff in <code>footer.html</code> to your liking.</p>

<h3 id="adding-posts-and-pages">Adding Posts and Pages</h3>

<p>There are two main content layouts: <code>post.html</code> (for posts) and <code>page.html</code> (for pages). Both have large <strong>feature images</strong> that span the full-width of the screen, and both are meant for text heavy blog posts (or articles).</p>

<h3 id="feature-images">Feature Images</h3>

<p>A good rule of thumb is to keep feature images nice and wide so you don’t push the body text too far down. An image cropped around around 1024 x 256 pixels will keep file size down with an acceptable resolution for most devices.</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">image:
# local image 
  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg
# link image
  feature: "http(s)://image.domain.com/feature-image-filename.jpg"
</code></pre>

<p>This makes the assumption that the feature image is in the <em>images</em> folder unless it has a link address. To add a feature image to a post or page just include the filename in the front matter like so.
You can “serve” images responsively with retina.js. All you need to do is have a file with @2x before the file type. That should be placed in the <em>images</em> folder. You literally don’t have to do anything other than that. 2 copies. One is linked. That’s it.
Ex:
<code>cool-photo@2x.jpg</code></p>

<p><em>*There is a default feature image that will show up for and posts. It isn’t retina or anything. It’s just there in case you want one but forget &lt;3</em></p>

<h4 id="if-you-dont-want-a-feature-image">If you don’t want a feature image</h4>
<p>…just say so in the front-matter. Go to your-post-name.md and make sure it has this guy up top.</p>
<pre><code>layout: post-no-feature
</code></pre>

<h3 id="categories">Categories</h3>

<p>In the sample <code>_posts</code> folder you may have noticed <code>category: articles</code> in the front matter. I like keeping all posts grouped in the same folder. If you decide to rename or add categories you will need to modify the permalink in <code>articles.md</code> along with the filename (if renaming).</p>

<p>For example. Say you want to group all your posts under <code>blog/</code> instead of <code>articles/</code>. In your post add <code>category: blog</code> to the front matter, rename or duplicate <code>articles.md</code> to <code>blog.md</code> and change the permalink in that file to <code>permalink: /blog/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>If done correctly <code>/blog</code> should be a page listing all the site’s posts.</p>
