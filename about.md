This site serves as a place for me to share and store some of my short stories – specifically, my short stories which might be considered part of or related to the Horror genre. It is a genre of writing I’ve always been interested in, and one I’ve experimented with in my writing for years. In particular, I’m interested in using Horror as a medium to explore deeper themes, while not taking the stories I write too seriously. I’ve also begun and would like to continue exploring the sub-genres of horror including: supernatural horror, atmospheric horror, grotesque horror, and even Gothic horror (should the inspiration for it strike). 

Over the course of the next year I plan to, as part of a writing Project, try and post stories here consistently. As a result of this, many of the stories I post will be first drafts and therefore unedited for the most part. I never know how I feel about a story and whether or not I’ll want to get into further drafts until it's done, but I am open to feedback, both general and specific story-related, and may end up editing previously posted stories at various times.

My only hope in writing is that whoever reads my stories will be entertained. Thank you very much for taking the time to visit this site.
